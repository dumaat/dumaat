- 👋 Hi, I’m Dumat
- 👀 I’m interested in mechanical engineering and electronics, I make combat robots; I work with 3D printers and 3D CAD Design on Solidworks. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about programming and that is why I created this github profile. I hope to post some CAD files and work on some code for 3D printers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically anything related to robotics, mechanical design and electronics.
- 📫 You can reach me here on GitHub.
